  <h2>Why would you refactor the charts?</h2>
  <p>
    If you look at the gif below, you'll notice that the chart takes ~800ms to
    load (trust me). I wouldn't be surprised if you thought the chart was being
    rendered by an abacus.
  </p>

    Reloading the Dashboard, slowed down 0.5x. Witness the jank, in
    <em>slowmo</em>!
  </figcaption>
  <p>
    Whenever I come across this kind of jank in modern software running on
    modern hardware, I get irked, and reasonably so. There is no reason for it
    to be this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Naturally, I had to do something about it. I initially thought about using
    something like <l href="https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js">Chart.js</l> or
    maybe <l href="https://github.com/d3/d3">D3</l> even. But there were
    multiple reasons not to:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The charting library used by Frappe Books was built in-house, so it would
      probably end up annoying someone.
    </li>
    <li>I needed a high degree of control over how the charts looked.</li>
    <li>
      An innate quotient for hubris that causes me to think
      <di>I wonder if can do it better...</di>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    I had no idea what it takes to make a chart. My only experience with
    charting data was from being spoonfed by
    <l href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib">matplotlib</l> and
    <l href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn">seaborn</l> (Python charting
    libraries).
  </p>

  <!-- Section Two -->
  <h2>The Refactoring</h2>
  <p>
    I initially thought of using
    <l href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API"
      >HTML Canvas</l
    >, but since Canvas has no DOM, it would involve writing code for object
    detection and what not. So I went with SVG.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given my lack of knowledge with how SVG worked, I thought it would take
    multiple days. But SVG primitives turned out to be suprisingly simple and
    rewriting the charts in Frappe Books took less than a day of
    <em>coding time</em>.
  </p>

  <!-- Section Two p One -->
  <h3>The Super Simple</h3>
  <p>
    The actual rewriting was easier, but more involved that I thought. For
    instance a simple line chart would be just a single SVG
    <code>&lt;path/&gt;</code> element:
  </p>
  <SimplePath />
  <p>
    Of course if I rewrote the Cashflow chart in Books using a single
    <code>&lt;path/&gt;</code> element, I'd very quickly become the company
    idiot.
  </p>

  <!-- Section Two p Three -->
  <h3>The Not So Simple</h3>
  <p>
    Things start to get a bit more involved when one gets into the deets of a
    chart.
    <di
      >A chart has to have labels! How can a chart not have labels, how will I
      know what the data is?</di
    >
    So we gotta add labels, two sets of them, for the <i>x</i> and the
    <i>y</i> axis:
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, once labels are added, some would argue that a line chart
    wouldn't be a line chart without grid and axis lines. Not the kind of people
    I would want to argue with, so we gotta add that in too.
  </p>
  <p>
    With all of that, things have to be customizable customizable right..
    <em>Right</em>? Right!
  </p>
  <LineChartContainer @showing-toggle="(b) => (controlsButtonText = b)"
    >Click on <i>{{ controlsButtonText }}</i> to toggle chart
    customization.</LineChartContainer
  >
  <p>
    Just adding in a few components has caused the simple line chart having just
    one <code>&lt;path/&gt;</code> element to explode in complexity.
    <em
      >You can
      <l href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/"
        >inspect element</l
      >
      to check how many elements it has now.</em
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    We aren't even half way there. The people who would argue about the axis and
    the grids, are probably going
    <di
      >You forgot the y-grid lines, also what about the x and y axis ticks,
      major ticks, minor ticks, I want to control the height of the ticks, inset
      ticks, outset...</di
    >
    but at this point I have my fingers in my ears and am slowly walking away.
  </p>

  <!-- Section Two p Three -->
  <h3>Cherry on the Chart</h3>
  <p>
    Another thing that bothered me about the chart was how the tooltip behaved.
    It was a <em>bit</em> jarring.
  </p>
  <p>
    Actually this wasn't an after thought, the crassness of this UX persists
    beyond the initial loading time. So it at least tantamount to the previous
    issue if not more important.
  </p>
  <img src="../assets/refactoring_charts/tooltip.gif" />
  <figcaption>The tooltip of no one's dreams.</figcaption>
  <p>
    If there are two lines and I'm hovering above the lower line, the tooltip
    shows above the upper line with info about both the points. <em>What?!</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    The kind of behaviour I want is that the tooltip appears above the cursor
    when I'm close to a datapoint and it should only show info pertinent to that
    point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, if you're as stupid as me, you're probably thinking
    <di>
      that's super simple to achieve, just slap an <code>onhover</code> on that
      point and call it day!
    </di>
    And you'd be wrong because:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The line has no points, it's a single element, so
      <code>onhover</code> would capture the entire line.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>onhover</code> works only if you're <em>on</em> the element, not
      near it.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    But, you're probably smarter than me and thought
    <di>that's not gonna be simple</di> and you're right. This involves:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Converting the cursor's DOM coordinates into SVG
      <code>viewBox</code> coordinates.
    </li>
    <li>Calculating the distance to all the points.</li>
    <li>Render tooltip on the basis of the distance.</li>
  </ol>

  <!-- Section Two p Three p One -->
  <h4>Point One - The Coordinates</h4>
  <p>
    This is fairly simple once you know that you can get the inverse
    transformation matrix from the SVG using:
  </p>
  <codeblock>const inv = svgElement.getScreenCTM().inverse();</codeblock>
  <p>
    Then you can create a <code>DOMPoint</code> using viewport coordinates,
    transform it, and get the SVG <code>viewBox</code> coordinates from it:
  </p>
  <codeblock>
    const {x, y} = new DOMPoint(cursorX, cursorY).matrixTransform(inv);
  </codeblock>
  <p>In the window below you can see the effect of the transform.</p>
  <CoordinatesTransform />

  <!-- Section Two p Three p Two -->
  <h4>Point Two - The Distance</h4>
  <p>
    Now we need to know which point are nearest to the cursor. For which we need
    to calculate the distance to all the points, <em>right?</em>
  </p>
  <p>You may have realized that:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>That the points lie on a grid.</li>
    <li>Each cell has exactly one point.</li>
    <li>The cursor can be only in one cell at a time.</li>
    <li>The coordinates of this cell can be obtained by division.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Because of this realization, a jank inducing <code>O(n)</code> becomes a
    quick <code>O(1)</code>. Now we just need to calculate the distance to a
    single point everytime <code>mouseover</code> is triggered over the SVG
    element.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      Note: by division I mean
      <code>Math.floor(cursorLocation / cellSize)</code>
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>Here's a box to illustrate this calculation:</p>
  <TheDistance />

  <!-- Section Two p Three p Three -->
  <h4>Point Three - The Tooltip</h4>
  <p>
    Okay, this is a bit anticlimactic. Frappe Books already had
    <l href="https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/virtual-elements/">popper.js</l>
    as a dependency, so I thought <di>eh, I'll just use that</di>. And so here
    üëá is the final line chart, tooltip and all, almost an exact replica of the
    one in Frappe Books!
  </p>
  <LineChartContainer
    :showTooltip="true"
    :showControls="false"
    :axisOn="false"
  ></LineChartContainer>

  <p>
    And if you're wondering about the jankiness of this implementation, here's a
    gif:
  </p>
  <img src="../assets/refactoring_charts/nojank.gif" />
  <figcaption>
    This too is slowed down 0.5x like the first gif, in fact I had to use a
    higher frame rate for the empty state to show.
  </figcaption>

  <hr />
  <p>A few closing thoughts...</p>
  <p>
    Writing sufficiently performant code is made much easier by using
    <l href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue">Vue.js</l>. CLOC of only the line
    chart at the time of writing is ~300. Doing this using Vanilla JS has
    potential to be faster (obviously) but would've been way more complicated,
    and much harder to do well.

    This post was just about the line chart, the donut chart was a
    <em>whole other thing</em>, not as complex, but more mathematically
    involved. Due to the absolutely unintuitive nature of drawing arcs in SVG,
    using <code>&lt;path/&gt;</code>, I had to breakout some trigo to solve this
    one. No, I won't be writing a post on that, you can
